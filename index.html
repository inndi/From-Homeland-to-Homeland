            <p class="homeland__text">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the
              Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their
              right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at
              some point.
              Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.
            </p>
            <p class="homeland__text">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture,
              all
              of it sprinkled with modified
              balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on
              bikes and
              those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by
              people
              who live on
              the far outskirts of the right one.

            <p class="homeland__text">The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock that
              juts out into the sea. It is thought to
              have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of
              Wales on the
              Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.
            </p>
            <p class="homeland__text">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice
              cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret
              ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won
              the
              Wales in
              Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to
              David Lloyd
              George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

            <p class="homeland__text"> Berea is a small town located in the central part  of Kentucky. The town is
              surrounded by beautiful forests and
              countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of
              shopping
              opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more.  The
              town holds a
              yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.
            </p>
            <p class="homeland__text">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was
              founded in 1855 and was the first college in
              the south to be racially integrated, as well  as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely,  it
              charges no
              tuition — every student receives  a full-tuition scholarship.

            <p class="homeland__text">Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya was
              the royal capital and in 2007, because
              of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is
              located in the
              center of Burundi, between the country's political and economic capitals.
            </p>
            <p class="homeland__text">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think you're
              in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft)
              above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for
              one of the
              largest plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.
            </p>
            <p class="homeland__text">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes, overlaps
              four provinces, including Muramvya.
              This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between
              1550 and 2660
              meters of altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and
              streams
              which
              provide water around the country.
